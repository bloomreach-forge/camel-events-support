      <subsection name="What is Apache Camel - Hippo Events Support?">
        <p>
          <strong>Apache Camel - Hippo Events Support</strong>
          provides <strong><a href="component-hippoevent.html">hippoevent:</a></strong> Apache Camel component,
          <a href="component-reposchedjob.html">Camel Repository Scheduler Job</a> component which can invoke a Camel Endpoint URI,
          and utility classes to help integration between Hippo CMS/Repository and Apache Camel.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <strong><a href="component-hippoevent.html">hippoevent:</a></strong> component is used for subscribing
          <code>HippoEvent</code> through <a href="http://www.onehippo.org/library/concepts/hippo-services/event-bus.html" target="_blank">Hippo Event Bus</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <strong><a href="component-reposchedjob.html">Camel Repository Scheduler Job</a></strong> component can be configured
          for a scheduled task and it can invoke a Camel Endpoint URI based on configuration.
          This makes it easier to create a scheduler task based on
          <a href="http://www.onehippo.org/library/concepts/hippo-services/repository-scheduler.html" target="_blank">Hippo Repository Scheduler</a>.
